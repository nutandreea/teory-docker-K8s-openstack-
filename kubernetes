Kubernetes Overview(k8s)
Open source product , most popular container orchestration
Container + Orchestration
Containers: docker is the most popular 
Docker: libraries +dependencies are running separately .Are completely isolated environments. They share the same OS kernel.
#docker run <nameofdocker>
Image is a package or a template(it is used to install one or more containers).
Dockers are images that are isolated and they have their own environment and set of processes.
Components:
a)API Server - acts as a front end for kubernetes, users , management devices all talk with API server to interact with cbernetes cluster
b)Etcd key value store to store all data used to manage the cluster, etcd data store information about all nodes in a distributed manner, implementing logs within the cluster to ensure there are no  conflicts between the masters
c)Kubelet agent to run inside each node in the cluster(containers are running on the node as expected)
d)Container Runtime underling software to run containers(docker)
e)Controller brain behind orchestration
f)Scheduler distributing work or containers across multiple nodes, it looks for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes

Worker node 
Container Runtime (docker as an engine)-running applications
Kubelet agent responsible to interact with the master to provide health information to the master about the worker node
Master Node
Kube-apiserver(this is what makes it a master)
Etcd(key vakue store) all the information gathered 
Controller
Scheduller
Kubectl - deploy and manage applications in the cluster
Kubectl get nodes
Kubectl cluster-info
Kubectl run
To run Kubernetes in Local Environment
-> minikube
Permanent kubernetes cluster on the cloud
-> Google Container Engine(GKE) 
Multi-node Kubernetes cluster in local environment
-> kubeadm
Install minikube
Install kubectl
Install a hypervisor(eg virtual Box)
Minikube status 
	Ø Kubectl get deployments
          kubectl get pods
Pod a single instance of an application, they can have multiple containers
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx ( create a pod using an image)
Kubectl get pods -o wide
Kubectl create -f pod-definition.yml
-> kubectl get nodes (how many nodes are in a cluster)
-> kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl describe pod newpods-<id>(to check he image that was used to create a pod)
->kubectl describe pod nameodpod | grep -i image
Get all pods from webapp
Kubectl get pods webapp (1/2 , 2 containers running in that pod)
Kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
Kubectl edit pod redis(podname)
Controllers are the brain behind kubernetes
Replication controller
Kubectl get replicationcontroller
Kubectl create -f rc-definition.yml
Replica set is a process that monitor the pod and in case one of them is failing to deploy a new one.
Kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yml
Kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset-definition.yml(without having to modify the replicaset)
Kubectl create -f replicaset-definition.yml
Kubectl get replicaset
Kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset
Kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yml
Kubectl describe replicaset myapp-replicaset
Kubectl get replicasets.apps _ to get replica sets
Kubectl apply -f replicaset-definition.yml
Kubectl describe deployments.apps frontend-deployment | grep -I image
Kubectl get deployment /kubectl get deployments
Kubect get pods
Kubectl get namespaces
See ~/ .kube/config file
Kubectl config get-contexts
Kubectl config set*
systemctl status kubelet  (systemctl restart kubelet)
kubectl get pods --show labels -n vault
kubectl get pods - A | grep horizon
for i in  `kubectl get pods -A -w | grep -ViE 'Running' awk "{print $2}"; do kubectl -n openstack delete pod 
kubectl get pods --show label 
kubectl get ingress -n openstack
kubectl -n openstack exec -it <NameOfPOD>



Create a service inside the"deployments" and then create service-definition.yml
Kubectl get svc
 minicube service myapp-service --url (to print the url where the service is accessible)
You define some properties like apiVersion , kind, metadata, spec
Load balancer type: for IP and port combination  
To get details: kubectl describe service 
To check how many deployments : kubectl get deployment
What is the image used to create pods in deployment: kubectl describe deployment
When you change a service definition.yaml then you need to run kubectl apply -f /root/service-definition-1.yaml
Example voting app:
1.deploy Containers
2.enable Connectivity
3.external access
Steps:
-deploy PODS(or replica set)
-enable connectivity between the services
Helm repo list
Helm repo update
Helm create hooktest
Service mesh -new layer in distributed app traffic for better control, security and monitoring
By default pods are only accesible on their internal IP address which has no access from outside the cluster you need to run kubectl expose depoyment hello-minikube --type=NodePort service/hello-minikube exposed.Exposing a deployment creates a Jubernetes service .We can view the servcie with (kubectl get services)Pods is the smallest building block .whitin a cluster a pod represents a process that's running/Inside of pod we can have one or more containers.
Volumes provide a way for the containers to communicate during the pod's life.
ReplicaSets is one of the Kubernetes Controllers that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running in a given time.Without ReplicaSet we would have to create multiple manifests for the number of pods needed. Label Selectors is used to identify a set of objects in Kubernetes.
DaemonsSets ensure that some or all your k8s nodes run a copy of a pod which allows you to run a daemon on every node.
When you add a new node to the cluster a pod gets added to match the nodes.
Types  of K8S services: a) ClusterIP (you can reach the service only from within the cluster) b) Node Port a cluster IP service is created automatically and the Node Port service will route to it.From outside the cluster you can contact the Node Port service by using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>; c) LoadBalancer (the external load balancer router to your NodePort and ClusterIp services which are created automatically. d) externalName this type maps the service to the contents of the externalName field.It does this by returning a value for the CNAME record
 to get all the pods in the default namesystem : kubectl get all -n kube-system  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces or  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces Kubelet is the primary node agent that runs on each node

Replicaset is managing the replicas of a Pod
To log in to a pod : kubectl exec -it [pod name] --bin/bash  
Create deployment : kubectl create deployment <deploymentName> -- image=nginx(for example)
vir to log in to a POD
kubetail 'neutron-api' -e regex -c neutron-api --since 20m -n openstack
kubectl -n openstack get pod -A -o wide | grep libvirt -check libvirt pods
kubectl -n openstack logs <eg neutron> | jq '.' ^C
kubectl -n openstack get pods | grep <pod name>
kubectl -n openstack get pods  grep <eg neutrion> | awk '{print $1}'
for i in 'kubectl -n openstack get pods | grep neutron-compute-sriov | awk '{print $1} '`; do kubectl <pod name> deleted
for pod in $(kubectl -n openstack get pods -o wide | grep sriov | grep agent | grep -v openvswitch | awk {print $1} ') do kubectl -n openstack log $pod | grep <ID>; done
kubectl -n openstack logs <pod that you are interested in>  grep <Port id> | jq '.message'
kubectl exec nameof pod  -i -t --bash



 



kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Running -get running podscd 
Namespaces : virtual cluster , has its onws set of resources 
 kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide -get all pods with more details 
From Course:
Imperative:
Ø kubectl run --image=nginx nginx
	Ø kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx
	Ø kubectl expose depoyment nginx --port 80
	Ø kubectl edit deployment nginx
	Ø kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas =5
	Ø kubectl set image deployment nginx nginx=nginx:1.18
	Ø kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
	Ø kubectl replace -f nginx.yaml
	Ø kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml
Declarative:

kubectl  -n openstack get pods -o wide  | grep hypervizor
openstack compute service list
